Machine learning and artificial intelligence are related fields, but they are not the same thing. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the broad field of computer science that is concerned with creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, is a specific subset of AI that involves training algorithms to automatically learn patterns and make predictions from data. In other words, machine learning is a technique used to implement artificial intelligence.

While AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches, machine learning is a specific subset of AI that relies on statistical and mathematical models to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

Another way to think about the difference between AI and machine learning is that AI is the overall goal or vision of creating intelligent machines, while machine learning is one of the key techniques used to achieve that goal.

It's worth noting that machine learning is not the only technique used in AI, and there are other approaches such as rule-based systems, expert systems, and genetic algorithms that are used in certain contexts. However, machine learning is one of the most popular and widely used techniques in modern AI research and applications.
