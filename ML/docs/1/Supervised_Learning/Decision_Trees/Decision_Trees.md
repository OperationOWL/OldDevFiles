A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of different input features, with the goal of maximizing the information gain at each split.

The decision tree starts with a root node, which represents the entire dataset. At each internal node, the algorithm selects a feature and creates a new branch for each possible value of that feature. The data is then split into subsets based on the value of the selected feature, and the process is repeated recursively for each subset until all of the data in a particular branch belongs to the same class or has similar regression output values.

In classification tasks, the decision tree is trained to predict the class label of an input sample. In regression tasks, the decision tree is trained to predict a continuous target value for an input sample. To make a prediction for a new input sample, the algorithm traverses the decision tree based on the values of the input features until it reaches a leaf node, which provides the predicted class label or target value.

One advantage of decision trees is that they are easy to interpret and visualize, which makes them a useful tool for understanding how different input features contribute to the final prediction. However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting, especially when the tree becomes too deep or complex. To prevent overfitting, techniques such as pruning, regularization, or ensemble methods (e.g., random forests) can be used.

Overall, decision trees are a popular and widely-used algorithm in machine learning, due to their interpretability, flexibility, and ability to handle both classification and regression tasks.
