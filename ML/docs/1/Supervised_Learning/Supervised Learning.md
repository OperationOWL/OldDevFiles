Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions based on labeled training data. In other words, the algorithm is given a set of input data along with their corresponding output values, and it learns to map the input to the correct output.

Here's an example: Suppose you want to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house based on its size and number of bedrooms. You might start by collecting a dataset of houses with their corresponding prices. Each data point in the dataset consists of the size and number of bedrooms of a house, as well as its price. The size and number of bedrooms are the input features, and the price is the output label.

Using this dataset, you could train a supervised learning algorithm to learn a function that maps the input features (size and number of bedrooms) to the output label (price). Once the algorithm has learned this function, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data (i.e., houses that were not in the training dataset).

Supervised learning can be further divided into two categories: classification and regression.

In classification, the algorithm learns to predict a categorical label, such as "spam" or "not spam" for email filtering, or "dog" or "cat" for image classification. The output label is a discrete value.

In regression, the algorithm learns to predict a continuous numerical output, such as the price of a house or the temperature of a city. The output label is a continuous value.

There are many different types of supervised learning algorithms, including [[Linear_Regression]], [[Logistic_Regression]], [[Decision_Trees]], [[Random_Forests]], 
[[Support_Vector_Machines]], and [[Neural_Networks]]. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the characteristics of your data.
