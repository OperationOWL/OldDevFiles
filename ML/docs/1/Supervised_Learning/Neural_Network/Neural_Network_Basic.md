At a high level, a neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes, called neurons, that process information and make predictions.

In a neural network, we start with an input layer, which receives the raw input data. The input layer is connected to one or more hidden layers, which process the input data and learn to identify patterns and relationships in the data. The final layer of the network is the output layer, which produces the predictions or classifications for the input data.

One of the key concepts in neural networks is the idea of training. During training, the network is presented with a set of input-output pairs, known as the training data. The network uses this data to adjust its weights and biases so that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

The process of adjusting the weights and biases in a neural network is called backpropagation. During backpropagation, the network calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias, and then adjusts these parameters in the direction that reduces the loss. This process is repeated many times, with different training examples, until the network's predictions on the training data are sufficiently accurate.

Another important concept in neural networks is the idea of [[Over_Fitting]]. Overfitting occurs when the network becomes too complex and starts to fit the training data too closely, at the expense of generalization to new, unseen data. One way to prevent overfitting is to use techniques such as regularization or early stopping.

There are many different types of neural networks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common types include feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Each type of network is designed to handle different types of data and tasks.

Neural networks have been applied to a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and many others. They have proven to be a powerful tool for solving complex problems and are continuing to be an active area of research and development.
The activation function in each neuron is typically a non-linear function, such as the sigmoid or ReLU function, which allows the network to learn non-linear relationships in the data. The non-linear nature of neural networks makes them well-suited to tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and many other applications.

Neural networks can be quite complex and there are many different types of architectures and algorithms that can be used. However, at a high level, the basic idea is to use layers of interconnected neurons to process and learn from data, and to use an optimization algorithm to adjust the weights and biases in the network to improve its predictions.
